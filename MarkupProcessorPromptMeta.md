# AI-Driven Meta-Prompt Generation

### Starting Meta-Prompt

The following meta-meta-prompt and a hand-written and meta-prompt draft were used for generating revised meta-prompts:

>Help me improve the following meta-prompt

>Help me improve the following LLM prompt:
>- Check general English usage
>- Pay attention to clarity, logical organization and flow, structure, structural and grammatical parallelism, etc.
>- Strive for positive and actionable language, keeping negatives and exceptions as clarifiers or emphasizers.
>- Identify potential ambiguities.
>- If relevant, suggest additional guidelines / details in line with overall prompt intent and goals.

The model generated two revised meta-prompts.

### Option 1: Direct Enhancement (Closer to original structure) - Actually Used

> **Review and Improve the following LLM Prompt:**  
>
>Analyze the provided LLM prompt based on these criteria. Provide specific, actionable feedback and suggestions for improvement:  
>1. **Clarity & Precision:** Is the language unambiguous? Are instructions direct? Identify potential ambiguities or vague terms.  
>2. **Structure & Flow:** Is it logically organized? Does it flow well? Check for parallelism (structural and grammatical).  
>3. **Language:**  
>    * Assess general English usage (grammar, spelling, punctuation).  
>    * Evaluate the use of positive and actionable language. Are negatives used effectively (e.g., for constraints, clarifications)?  
>1. **Completeness:** Does it seem to contain all necessary information for the LLM to perform the task effectively (context, constraints, desired output)?  
>2. **Suggestions for Enhancement:** Based on the likely intent, suggest any additional guidelines, details, or restructuring that would improve the prompt's effectiveness and the quality of the LLM's response.
