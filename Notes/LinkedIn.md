AI-Generated VBA: Balancing Prompt Effort vs. Debugging in Word/Zotero Macro Development

How much effort should go into prompt engineering vs. debugging when using AI for code generation? I explored this in the GenAIandVBA project, using advanced meta-prompting strategies to develop VBA macros that enhance the Word/Zotero academic writing workflow.

My findings suggest a trade-off: quick meta-prompting on relatively concise prompts yields fast solutions for basic tasks. However, for more complex VBA code that modifies Word documents, investing in more detailed prompts to guide the AI's logic upfront seems beneficial, potentially reducing debugging time later.

It's a small case study, but the full process, VBA code, prompts, and AI conversations are shared on GitHub for those interested in AI-driven development, particularly with VBA or for academic workflows: https://github.com/pchemguy/GenAIandVBA

Okay, here are a couple of options reformatted into plain text paragraphs suitable for pasting directly into LinkedIn:

**Option 1 (Paragraph Style - Problem/Solution Focus):**

Many researchers using Word, Zotero, and AI assistants face the frustration of losing critical metadata, like Zotero citation fields or internal document links, when transferring text for revisions. Standard Zotero integration also lacks easy navigation from citations to the bibliography. To address this, I explored using AI itself for a solution, employing prompt-driven development with Google Gemini Pro and meta-prompting techniques to create a suite of VBA macros for Word. These tools aim to preserve Zotero fields during external editing, manage internal links via plain-text markup, and automatically add helpful citation-to-bibliography hyperlinks.

I've shared the VBA modules, the prompts used to generate them, and insights from the AI-assisted development process on GitHub. If you're navigating the Word/Zotero/AI authoring workflow, I hope you find these tools and the methodology useful. Check out the repository here: [Link to your GitHub Repository]

**Option 2 (Paragraph Style - AI/Methodology Focus):**

I have been exploring how AI-driven development can create practical tools for specific workflow challenges. 


The GenAIandVBA project focuses on illustrating and applying several advanced meta-prompting strategies to AI-driven development of several VBA macros that enhance the academic writing process in Microsoft Word with Zotero. The methodological goal was to explore different meta-prompting approaches to probe the balance between time invested in prompt engineering, subsequent code debugging, and overall code quality. The practical goal was to tackle common issues like citation metadata loss when using external AI editors and the lack of built-in citation navigation.

The resulting VBA macros help preserve Zotero fields, manage internal links via plain-text markup, and add citation-to-bibliography hyperlinks. This small experiment demonstrated that brief prompts expanded by LLM via intermediate meta-prompting may provide usable automation solutions to relatively simple task relatively quickly. However, when subsequent AI-driven development of the generated code may be necessary, particularly if the code actively handles document object and modifies it, more elaborate prompts steering the LLM towards a particular code logic workflow may be benefits. I have shared the complete process on GitHub, including the VBA code, the prompts, and links to the AI development conversations, serving as a case study in applying LLMs to a specific software development task.
