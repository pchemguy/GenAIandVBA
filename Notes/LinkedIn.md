Meta-Prompting for AI-Driven VBA Coding: Balancing Prompt Effort vs. Debugging in Word/Zotero Macro Development

How much effort should go into prompt engineering versus debugging when using AI for VBA code generation? I explored this trade-off in the GenAIandVBA project, using advanced meta-prompting strategies to develop VBA macros enhancing the Word/Zotero academic writing workflow. The practical goal was to fix common issues like losing Zotero citation metadata or internal links when using AI assistants, and adding missing citation navigation.

My findings suggest a trade-off: quick meta-prompting on concise prompts yields fast solutions for basic tasks. However, for complex problems requiring subsequent AI-driven development of the initial code, investing in more detailed prompts to guide the AI's logic upfront appears beneficial, often streamlining later debugging.
